SimpleStorage Smart Contract
The SimpleStorage Smart Contract is a basic smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain. This repository is a starting point for developers who want to learn more about writing and deploying smart contracts.

Getting started
To use the SimpleStorage Smart Contract, you will need the following:

A development environment for writing and testing smart contracts (such as Remix, Truffle, or Ganache)
An Ethereum wallet to deploy and interact with the contract (such as Metamask or MyEtherWallet)
Using the contract
The SimpleStorage Smart Contract has two functions:

setData(uint256 _data): Sets the value of the data variable to the input parameter _data.
getData() public view returns (uint256): Returns the current value of the data variable.
To use the contract, follow these steps:

Compile and deploy the contract using your development environment.
Use your Ethereum wallet to interact with the contract.
Call the setData function to set a value for the data variable.
Call the getData function to retrieve the current value of the data variable.
